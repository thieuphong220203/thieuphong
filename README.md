Project Description:
For my project, I've developed a responsive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes multiple pages such as an "About Me" section and an "Index" showcasing my work. It features a dark and light theme toggle for user preference. I've incorporated the Swiper library for the testimonial section and implemented interactive features like downloading my CV in PDF format. Additionally, there's a detailed project description feature, a team section, and integration with GitHub and Facebook profiles. The website is optimized for performance to ensure a smooth user experience.

Functions:

- Download CV: Allows users to download your CV in PDF format directly from the website.
- Detailed Project Descriptions: Provides users with detailed descriptions of your projects upon clicking "More Details" on the index page.
- Testimonial Section: Utilizes the Swiper library for an interactive testimonial section on the index page.
- Team Section: Showcases information about your team members.
- Social Media Integration: Links to your GitHub and Facebook profiles for users to explore.
- Dark/Light Theme Toggle: Allows users to switch between dark and light themes for optimal viewing.
- Responsive Design: Ensures the website looks and functions well across different devices and screen sizes.

Techniques:

- HTML: Used for structuring the content of the website.
